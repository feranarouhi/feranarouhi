Hello there! I'm Ferana Rouhi Maleki, a junior programmer with nearly two years 
of hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, Java, C#, and JavaScript. Currently,
I'm a dedicated student, eagerly expanding my skills and knowledge in the dynamic world of programming.
My passion lies in web development, where I find joy in creating and refining small projects.
While web development is my current focus, I remain open to exploring and diving into other 
fields to broaden my expertise. Excited about the endless possibilities within the realm of programming,
I'm always ready for new challenges and learning opportunities.
